Module Inquiry 2

1. What technical choices did you make today?
	All of the technical choices were already made. We are using Heroku and many APIs for our data that have already been
	completed

2. Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?
	a. Using Heroku
	b. Current APIs
	c. Technically, nothing since this was already done. However, I was hoping to use FastAPI instead of Heroku

	- Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
		Much quicker to build on what is already done and working

	- Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.
		Sometimes what is already in place is not exactly what you want or what you wanted to do

3. In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.
	- The choice that was ultimately made was already made so I chose to follow that route.

4. Extracting useful conclusions from your process:
	- According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?

	What makes a good technical choice is one that solves the current problem, can be completed in the necessary time frame,
	and all team members are on board with the decision. If not, then perhaps a new direction or a compromise is in order.
